    <h3 id="concise-description">Concise Description</h3>

<p>To create a computer graphics library that is based on Disney’s <a href="https://vimeo.com/93206523">12 principles of animation</a>. By using the library to write a few lines of code, be able to make a character out of any primary shape for example a sphere, cube , circle, triangle etc. Through this process, I also expect to learn more about graphics programming (OpenGL). This will be developed in C++ possibly using Cinder.</p>

<h4 id="who-is-it-for">Who is it for?</h4>
<p>It is mainly for myself with the possibility of being used by others if the development gets to a stage where the code is polished.</p>

<h4 id="what-do-you-want-as-a-user-even-if-it-is-for-yourself-when-interacting-with-the-work-to-">What do you want as a user (even if it is for yourself) when interacting with the work to ?</h4>

<h4 id="feel">– Feel</h4>
<pre><code>	I want the user to feel in control of what they create. #### -- Do
	I want to be able to let the user create animations with only by importing the library and writing a few lines of code. The user will be able to tweak and play around with the parameters. These animations would have otherwise needed to be done in animation software like After Effects or Blender.
</code></pre>

<h4 id="know">– Know</h4>
<pre><code>	The user doesn't need to know much about animation while getting results that may have taken a lot more time otherwise. The idea is to make it approachable to creating animations using code.
</code></pre>

<h4 id="what-is-the-problem-you-are-trying-to-solve-and-what-is-your-recommended-solution">What is the “problem” you are trying to solve and what is your recommended solution</h4>
<p>When I was learning processing the problem I found is that it is really hard to create simple pleasing animations using code. Either knowledge of the way graphics work was required or other animation software like Blender or After Effects had to be used to achieve the same result. This meant that these softwares had to be learnt and the same skills couldn’t be carried across different softwares. The library will help in prototyping with animations by making it more approachable even though the user may not have previous experience with animation. </p>

<p>Solution:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Study other animation libraries and understand how basic animations are performed.</li>
  <li>Prototype using Cinder or Processing.</li>
  <li>Start by creating animations for 2D shapes</li>
  <li>Study animations for 3D shapes and think about parameters necessary for the user to be in control of the shapes.</li>
  <li>Make the code into a library. </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="why-use-code-instead-of-creating-animations-in-">Why use code instead of creating animations in ……..?</h4>
<p>Code allows the applications to have a lot more flexibility. The user doesn’t need to be restricted to a video format. With code the prototyping can be much faster while also allowing the user to perform and draw advanced graphics and animations.</p>

<h4 id="what-are-the-opportunities-that-you-see-in-the-problem-space">What are the opportunities that you see in the problem space?</h4>
<p>There are a lot of opportunities in this space. 
1. To able to give any user who is either learning to write code or experimenting to create graphics/animations the ability to perform animations with very little setup and requirements.
2. To be able to create animations that previously would require the use of other animation software that had their own learning curve.
3. The possibility of letting the user learn coding and animation through experimentation and prototyping.</p>

<h4 id="what-are-the-general-challenges-in-the-problem-area-and-what-do-you-think-will-be-your-specific-challenges">What are the general challenges in the problem area and what do you think will be your specific challenges</h4>
<p>The general challenges in the area is that its difficult to create animations that look both pleasing in a small amount of time using with little knowledge about the process. The user has to go through a training phase of first understanding the process and software before making something. Depending on how skilled the user is, this can take anywhere from few hours to weeks.
Challenges:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Leaning the theory of graphics and animations can take up time.</li>
  <li>Understanding what animations need to be performed needs to investigated by looking at other animations, artists and lots of experimentation.</li>
  <li>Making a library that would help with quick prototyping while providing decent results.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="what-research-with-references-have-you-done-so-far-articles-related-projects-materials-etc">What research (with references) have you done so far (articles, related projects, materials etc)</h4>

<ul>
  <li>https://vimeo.com/93206523</li>
  <li>I have been reading books on computer graphics during the summer</li>
  <li>I also been prototyping with simple code however I haven’t made too much progress.</li>
  <li>I have also been looking at other frameworks like <a href="libcinder.org">cinder</a>, <a href="openframeworks.cc">openframeworks</a> and <a href="processing.org">processing</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-are-the-technical-interactional-requirements-for-your-project">What are the technical, interactional requirements for your project</h3>
<p>Technical : Theory of graphics, OpenGL, C++, understand how animations are performed.
Interactional : Understand graphics and animations by looking at the code of creative frameworks like cinder/openframeworks/processing/threejs.</p>

<ol>
  <li>What kind of algorithms are required for the animations?</li>
  <li>Can I learn by looking at other libraries that are out there?</li>
  <li>How do I ask and receive feedback if this was used by other animators or developers?</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="what-are-your-criteria-of-success-how-will-you-know-you-have-succeeded--how-do-you-plan-to-evaluate-this-success">What are your criteria of success (how will you know you have succeeded) &amp; how do you plan to evaluate this success?</h4>
<p>By the end of the process if I am able to understand more about graphics, animations and be able to perform those with minimal effort of coding.
I plan to let others who have little experience with coding to use the library and see if they are able to use it and create animations by just reading the documentation.</p>

<h4 id="timeline">Timeline</h4>

<p>Week 1 - Read theory behind simple animations and prototype</p>

<p>Week 2 &amp; 3- Continue prototyping with Cinder</p>

<p>Week 4 &amp; 5 - Write code to perform animations for one primary 2d shape</p>

<p>Week 6 - Get feedback</p>

<p>Week 7 - Tweak according to feedback</p>

<p>Week 8 - Write code to perform animations with other primary shapes</p>

<p>Week 9 &amp; 10 - Prototype with 3d shape</p>

<p>Week 11 - Get feedback and tweak for other shapes</p>

<p>Week 12 - Package code into library</p>

<p>Week 13 - Cleanup</p>

<p>Week 14 - Presentation</p>

<p><em><strong>In ME++ Mitchell talks about “electronic nervous systems” of intelligent urban environments. Discuss an example of an intelligent urban system you are familiar with and discuss the elements of the feedback loop, how its form of governance works, and who are its stakeholders (goals, decision makers, evaluators, etc.).</strong></em></p>

<p>In the book ME++, Mitchell discusses about how we as humans have gone from being self reliant in a way on our own selves with our bodies adapting to the environments around us to increasingly augmenting and relying on tools and systems that can be thought as extending ourselves. These tools have increasingly extended very different things (for example he describes them as extedning our limbs, eyes, sensors, spaces etc) but are interconnected in ways that can only be described as complex. He draws parallels between this network and our bodies. There are a few examples I can think of in terms of intelligent urban systems. </p>

<p>One of them is the power grids that exist in every country. These central grids are interconnected with wires that span across states and every central grid is connected to individual homes in communities. These are essential for survival of businesses and livelihood as we become increasingly become dependent on it. However I wouldnt call these intelligent. These grids maybe intelligent within the same operator generating and distributing to homes depending on the consumption per day but they are reliant on price negotiations and contracts when the supply is insufficient and the anticipated demands exceed unusally. This was evident especially in the recent <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/01/world/asia/power-outages-hit-600-million-in-india.html?pagewanted=all">power outage</a> in India where more than half(!) the country was left without power for many days. Even in major cities in India with big businesses operating, I see a power outages almost every day. The stakeholders here were the central and state governments with people having little say in the overall decision process. This was a failure on the doing the estimation of the demand that was clearly increasing with people in underdeveloped areas now having access to electronics &amp; lights dependent on the grid. One way to solve this would have been to decentralize the feedback loop so that if a large number of decentralized nodes show an increase in consumption, the trend can easily be understood.</p>

<p>Similar to power distribution networks, there are also water systems that exist. Water sharing is a heavy political topic especially in India where states individually form agreements between each other and elections are won/lost based on these promises made by governments. The rivers in India only flow through certain states giving them power in negotiations. A lot times these systems break down because governments artificially block the flow of water. Here the feedback may not necessarily be the demand but rather the political will that is present. The decisions are made by the state government and can often be sentimental rather than logical. So in a way, the government is the nervous system with the minister(evaluators) acting as its brain but heavily reliant on public polls and votes.Unfortunately the effects of this are felt by people and businesses who may not have any say.</p>

<p><em><strong>Read MIT’s report on driverless automobiles (ignore all technical stuff and focus on results). Suppose that in few years we have driverless automobiles that can be used in shared schemes without the need for redistribution. Is this a plausible solution/future for you?</strong></em></p>

<p>It could definitely be a possible solution to have shared schemes based on driverless vehicles. However this would also be dependent on the players that are controlling these systems. If there are few players, then the system can suffer from the centralised problem that is present where the players can demand higher prices however it will be interesting to have decentralised network that works in favour of the user rather than for the players.</p>

<p>I want to continue working on my previous idea which is creating a storytelling app that offers the ability to use APIs directly in a drag and drop style.
I am also working on having a user log in and signup pages so that whatever API the user decides to use, it is associated with the user when they log in the next time.</p>

<p>You can see a prototype <a href="http://evening-wave-1710.herokuapp.com/">here</a></p>

<h4 id="description">Description</h4>
<p>I will be creating a storytelling app that offers drag and drop style animation elements.
The storytelling editor will have a timeline which can be used to move elements on the screen. However where it differs from After effects or similar programs is that, the elements on the screen react according to the data received back from calling the API.
For example the weather in the scene changes according to the current weather or a character reacts to the current news (say from NYTimes).
 Node js will mainly be used for serving data using an API, accepting input, managing sessions and storing information in a database. </p>

<p>For this I made a prototype version which you can find <a href="http://adarshk.com/itp/mashups/wk8/index.html">here</a></p>

<p>I used PaperJS for the animation which is using SVG to draw on the canvas.</p>

    <p>I used last fm api to retrieve the top tracks from a list of countries.
For each track, I am getting the number of listeners along with the name of the track and artist.
