  <content type="html">&lt;h3 id=&quot;concise-description&quot;&gt;Concise Description&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To create a computer graphics library that is based on Disney’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/93206523&quot;&gt;12 principles of animation&lt;/a&gt;. By using the library to write a few lines of code, be able to make a character out of any primary shape for example a sphere, cube , circle, triangle etc. Through this process, I also expect to learn more about graphics programming (OpenGL). This will be developed in C++ possibly using Cinder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;who-is-it-for&quot;&gt;Who is it for?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is mainly for myself with the possibility of being used by others if the development gets to a stage where the code is polished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-do-you-want-as-a-user-even-if-it-is-for-yourself-when-interacting-with-the-work-to-&quot;&gt;What do you want as a user (even if it is for yourself) when interacting with the work to ?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;feel&quot;&gt;– Feel&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;	I want the user to feel in control of what they create. #### -- Do
	I want to be able to let the user create animations with only by importing the library and writing a few lines of code. The user will be able to tweak and play around with the parameters. These animations would have otherwise needed to be done in animation software like After Effects or Blender.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;know&quot;&gt;– Know&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;	The user doesn&#39;t need to know much about animation while getting results that may have taken a lot more time otherwise. The idea is to make it approachable to creating animations using code.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-is-the-problem-you-are-trying-to-solve-and-what-is-your-recommended-solution&quot;&gt;What is the “problem” you are trying to solve and what is your recommended solution&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was learning processing the problem I found is that it is really hard to create simple pleasing animations using code. Either knowledge of the way graphics work was required or other animation software like Blender or After Effects had to be used to achieve the same result. This meant that these softwares had to be learnt and the same skills couldn’t be carried across different softwares. The library will help in prototyping with animations by making it more approachable even though the user may not have previous experience with animation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Solution:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Study other animation libraries and understand how basic animations are performed.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Prototype using Cinder or Processing.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Start by creating animations for 2D shapes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Study animations for 3D shapes and think about parameters necessary for the user to be in control of the shapes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make the code into a library. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;why-use-code-instead-of-creating-animations-in-&quot;&gt;Why use code instead of creating animations in ……..?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Code allows the applications to have a lot more flexibility. The user doesn’t need to be restricted to a video format. With code the prototyping can be much faster while also allowing the user to perform and draw advanced graphics and animations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-are-the-opportunities-that-you-see-in-the-problem-space&quot;&gt;What are the opportunities that you see in the problem space?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of opportunities in this space. 
1. To able to give any user who is either learning to write code or experimenting to create graphics/animations the ability to perform animations with very little setup and requirements.
2. To be able to create animations that previously would require the use of other animation software that had their own learning curve.
3. The possibility of letting the user learn coding and animation through experimentation and prototyping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-are-the-general-challenges-in-the-problem-area-and-what-do-you-think-will-be-your-specific-challenges&quot;&gt;What are the general challenges in the problem area and what do you think will be your specific challenges&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The general challenges in the area is that its difficult to create animations that look both pleasing in a small amount of time using with little knowledge about the process. The user has to go through a training phase of first understanding the process and software before making something. Depending on how skilled the user is, this can take anywhere from few hours to weeks.
Challenges:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Leaning the theory of graphics and animations can take up time.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Understanding what animations need to be performed needs to investigated by looking at other animations, artists and lots of experimentation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Making a library that would help with quick prototyping while providing decent results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-research-with-references-have-you-done-so-far-articles-related-projects-materials-etc&quot;&gt;What research (with references) have you done so far (articles, related projects, materials etc)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;https://vimeo.com/93206523&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I have been reading books on computer graphics during the summer&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I also been prototyping with simple code however I haven’t made too much progress.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I have also been looking at other frameworks like &lt;a href=&quot;libcinder.org&quot;&gt;cinder&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;openframeworks.cc&quot;&gt;openframeworks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;processing.org&quot;&gt;processing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-are-the-technical-interactional-requirements-for-your-project&quot;&gt;What are the technical, interactional requirements for your project&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technical : Theory of graphics, OpenGL, C++, understand how animations are performed.
Interactional : Understand graphics and animations by looking at the code of creative frameworks like cinder/openframeworks/processing/threejs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What kind of algorithms are required for the animations?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Can I learn by looking at other libraries that are out there?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How do I ask and receive feedback if this was used by other animators or developers?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-are-your-criteria-of-success-how-will-you-know-you-have-succeeded--how-do-you-plan-to-evaluate-this-success&quot;&gt;What are your criteria of success (how will you know you have succeeded) &amp;amp; how do you plan to evaluate this success?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of the process if I am able to understand more about graphics, animations and be able to perform those with minimal effort of coding.
I plan to let others who have little experience with coding to use the library and see if they are able to use it and create animations by just reading the documentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;timeline&quot;&gt;Timeline&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Week 1 - Read theory behind simple animations and prototype&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Week 2 &amp;amp; 3- Continue prototyping with Cinder&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Week 4 &amp;amp; 5 - Write code to perform animations for one primary 2d shape&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In ME++ Mitchell talks about “electronic nervous systems” of intelligent urban environments. Discuss an example of an intelligent urban system you are familiar with and discuss the elements of the feedback loop, how its form of governance works, and who are its stakeholders (goals, decision makers, evaluators, etc.).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the book ME++, Mitchell discusses about how we as humans have gone from being self reliant in a way on our own selves with our bodies adapting to the environments around us to increasingly augmenting and relying on tools and systems that can be thought as extending ourselves. These tools have increasingly extended very different things (for example he describes them as extedning our limbs, eyes, sensors, spaces etc) but are interconnected in ways that can only be described as complex. He draws parallels between this network and our bodies. There are a few examples I can think of in terms of intelligent urban systems. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of them is the power grids that exist in every country. These central grids are interconnected with wires that span across states and every central grid is connected to individual homes in communities. These are essential for survival of businesses and livelihood as we become increasingly become dependent on it. However I wouldnt call these intelligent. These grids maybe intelligent within the same operator generating and distributing to homes depending on the consumption per day but they are reliant on price negotiations and contracts when the supply is insufficient and the anticipated demands exceed unusally. This was evident especially in the recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/01/world/asia/power-outages-hit-600-million-in-india.html?pagewanted=all&quot;&gt;power outage&lt;/a&gt; in India where more than half(!) the country was left without power for many days. Even in major cities in India with big businesses operating, I see a power outages almost every day. The stakeholders here were the central and state governments with people having little say in the overall decision process. This was a failure on the doing the estimation of the demand that was clearly increasing with people in underdeveloped areas now having access to electronics &amp;amp; lights dependent on the grid. One way to solve this would have been to decentralize the feedback loop so that if a large number of decentralized nodes show an increase in consumption, the trend can easily be understood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar to power distribution networks, there are also water systems that exist. Water sharing is a heavy political topic especially in India where states individually form agreements between each other and elections are won/lost based on these promises made by governments. The rivers in India only flow through certain states giving them power in negotiations. A lot times these systems break down because governments artificially block the flow of water. Here the feedback may not necessarily be the demand but rather the political will that is present. The decisions are made by the state government and can often be sentimental rather than logical. So in a way, the government is the nervous system with the minister(evaluators) acting as its brain but heavily reliant on public polls and votes.Unfortunately the effects of this are felt by people and businesses who may not have any say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read MIT’s report on driverless automobiles (ignore all technical stuff and focus on results). Suppose that in few years we have driverless automobiles that can be used in shared schemes without the need for redistribution. Is this a plausible solution/future for you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It could definitely be a possible solution to have shared schemes based on driverless vehicles. However this would also be dependent on the players that are controlling these systems. If there are few players, then the system can suffer from the centralised problem that is present where the players can demand higher prices however it will be interesting to have decentralised network that works in favour of the user rather than for the players.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;idea-1&quot;&gt;Idea 1:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to continue working on my previous idea which is creating a storytelling app that offers the ability to use APIs directly in a drag and drop style.
I am also working on having a user log in and signup pages so that whatever API the user decides to use, it is associated with the user when they log in the next time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see a prototype &lt;a href=&quot;http://evening-wave-1710.herokuapp.com/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;idea-2&quot;&gt;Idea 2:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating animation style web based story that automatically starts playing when a user loads the page. Telling the story using the web as a medium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;description&quot;&gt;Description&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will be creating a storytelling app that offers drag and drop style animation elements.
The storytelling editor will have a timeline which can be used to move elements on the screen. However where it differs from After effects or similar programs is that, the elements on the screen react according to the data received back from calling the API.
For example the weather in the scene changes according to the current weather or a character reacts to the current news (say from NYTimes).
 Node js will mainly be used for serving data using an API, accepting input, managing sessions and storing information in a database. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see the protoype &lt;a href=&quot;http://evening-wave-1710.herokuapp.com/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used PaperJS for the animation which is using SVG to draw on the canvas.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I used last fm api to retrieve the top tracks from a list of countries.
For each track, I am getting the number of listeners along with the name of the track and artist.
I then use google maps to get the coordinates for each country. I am displaying these as markers on the map.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also used two.js to put dots on the map. However I want to continue working on this next week to animate the dots according to the track.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;h3 id=&quot;mobile-payments-presentation&quot;&gt;‘Mobile Payments Presentation’&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The task this week was to choose any topic related to how connected devices affect our lives, particularly mobile phones. I and Yu Ji decided to present on mobile payments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that a lot of tech companies have been trying to solve the problem of mobile payments. It particularly took off when square reader was introduced a few years back. And then a lot services started using NFC especially google wallet. With the recent talks that Apple maybe introducing its own service, this is definitely going to be a huge market in itself. But until now, it has not been as successful as the industry had hoped initially. This has seen Google going back to introducing a debit card based service along with Mastercard. In the presentation below, we also talk about the future implications mobile payments may have. Please take a look at it below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week we gave the presentation on 3 different sensor concepts that we would like to see in the future. I think these are particularly useful and can easily be integrated into the existing infrasturcture.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I decide to make a concept for a fun game in which photos are pulled from your social feed or from the current trending news and you have to fill in a place where the event in the photograph is taking place. I thought this would be fun to not only play but also learn and gain knowledge. I decided on this as I didnt find anything out there that was similar. I found one which uses google street view but does not use photographs taken from your friends social feed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;utitleu---photo-guesser&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Title&lt;/u&gt; - Photo Guesser&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;uconceptu&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Concept&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A game in which a user has to guess the place where the photo was taken based on photos from google images, flickr, Instagram etc and from photos take by his friends on social networks and also from top news stories of the last 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;uuseru&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;User&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A user would be someone who is interested in playing a game for fun or entertainment and also gain some knowledge from the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;ustoryu&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Story&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A user is interested in keeping up with news, his social feed or just wants to explore the world. Instead of showing them articles, the user sees the world through photos. If they get the right answers they are given a short summary of the event and can explore more from inside the app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;uwireframesu&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Wireframes&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adarshk.com/itp/images/work/AOAC-first2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adarshk.com/itp/images/work/AOAC-last2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adarshk.com/itp/images/work/allWireframes.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--
&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;images/work/AOAC-first2.png&quot; alt=&quot;StartScreen&quot;&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;images/work/AOAC-last2.png&quot; alt=&quot;GameScreen&quot;&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;images/work/allWireframes.png&quot; alt=&quot;GameScreen&quot;&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
--&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;part-2---response-to-the-fable-of-the-user-centered-designer&quot;&gt;Part 2 - Response to ‘The Fable of the User-Centered Designer’&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After reading the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.userfocus.co.uk/pdf/fable.pdf&quot;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt;, its amazing how the author uses examples and story to clearly drive the important points. A lot designers are drowned in decisions about what to use and forget completely about the actual users. The 3 key points that the author makes are I think pretty powerful. I also think it extends beyond design to everything from programming to writing reusable code that can be maintained to aesthetics and ergonomics in any product. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The philosophy somewhat reflects the current trend which is to move quickly, fail early and iterate. Also the fact that, this has to be done in every stage of the proces because its easy to lose focus if only done the first time. The early focus on how everyday users use it is much more important than how you as a designer may find it more pleasing. Approaching the task from the target audience perspective is will pay off in the end. s&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;h3 id=&quot;open-api&quot;&gt;Open API&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For open API this week, I initialy decided to use DuckDuckGo’s API but after coming across Giphy’s open &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/giphy/GiphyAPI&quot;&gt;API&lt;/a&gt; I couldnt resist.The API is well documented and JSON can be retrived with a url similar to this format. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;http://api.giphy.com/v1/gifs/search?q=funny+cat&amp;amp;api_key=dc6zaTOxFJmzC 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example a search for the terms ‘are+you+serious’ returns json with a bunch of gif urls with different formats such as fixed height, fixed width etc.  You can also retrieve gifs by id, tag and trending.By reading their license, it looks like, the number of requests are determined at their discretion but since its in beta they are allowing unrestricted access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also find the html/css source &lt;a href=&quot;mashups/wk1/index.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;h3 id=&quot;relationship-with-my-phone&quot;&gt;Relationship with my phone&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The relationship with my phone is somewhat a strange one. I have been using one for many years now. Over the years, the amount of time I spend with it has only increased. And the amount of time I am &lt;em&gt;expected&lt;/em&gt; to spend with it has also increased. By that I mean, I am expected to respond to emails, calls, texts etc faster. The people on the other side sending me stuff assume that I have already seen the content as soon as they sent it. While the number of ways to communicate has taken on different forms such as social networking sites, photo sharing, the phone is still the primary enabler of this complex connected world. Ten years ago this was not the case. I did not own a cellphone that time let alone a featurephone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowadays almost everything is done through my phone. Bus, Plane, Train, Movie tickets, receipts, exchanging text, photos, having video calls, playing games, connecting with friends on social networks, consuming news and a lot of times buying things. In fact there are very few things that I dont do with my phone. With my phone carrying such a huge importance, it is not over the top to say the phone is merely an extension of me. It has become such an important part of my life that I couldnt imagine a life without it. My smartphone has become the de facto way of living life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the value of the phone is less about the monetary price of the object and more about incredible human value and life memories that I derive from it. But it can also be an easy distraction. Just like any other medium its not without its problems. Because communication has become so cheap I value it less everyday. It’s easy to forsake human relationships by substituting your phone. But it’s also true vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I said in the beginning the relationship with my phone is somewhat a strange one. Whenever I want to get some work done I usually put it aside and not let it distract me. However looking forward I only see this getting reversed. As more of the functionality moves into the phone, it will only make it harder to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;
