&lt;h4 id=&quot;description&quot;&gt;Description&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will be creating a storytelling app that offers drag and drop style animation elements.
The storytelling editor will have a timeline which can be used to move elements on the screen. However where it differs from After effects or similar programs is that, the elements on the screen react according to the data received back from calling the API.
For example the weather in the scene changes according to the current weather or a character reacts to the current news (say from NYTimes).
 Node js will mainly be used for serving data using an API, accepting input, managing sessions and storing information in a database. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see the protoype &lt;a href=&quot;http://evening-wave-1710.herokuapp.com/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used last fm api to retrieve the top tracks from a list of countries.
For each track, I am getting the number of listeners along with the name of the track and artist.
I then use google maps to get the coordinates for each country. I am displaying these as markers on the map.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also used two.js to put dots on the map. However I want to continue working on this next week to animate the dots according to the track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Find the code &lt;a href=&quot;mashups/wk4/withMarkers/project.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; with markers. 
Find the code &lt;a href=&quot;mashups/wk4/withDots/project.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; with dots. &lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;h3 id=&quot;mobile-payments-presentation&quot;&gt;‘Mobile Payments Presentation’&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The task this week was to choose any topic related to how connected devices affect our lives, particularly mobile phones. I and Yu Ji decided to present on mobile payments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that a lot of tech companies have been trying to solve the problem of mobile payments. It particularly took off when square reader was introduced a few years back. And then a lot services started using NFC especially google wallet. With the recent talks that Apple maybe introducing its own service, this is definitely going to be a huge market in itself. But until now, it has not been as successful as the industry had hoped initially. This has seen Google going back to introducing a debit card based service along with Mastercard. In the presentation below, we also talk about the future implications mobile payments may have. Please take a look at it below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1w51Qr0uN__kfrVuh0B0rLsCLV5Q9TKDbLcDDlu2nFZY/embed?start=false&amp;amp;loop=false&amp;amp;delayms=3000&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;299&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I decide to make a concept for a fun game in which photos are pulled from your social feed or from the current trending news and you have to fill in a place where the event in the photograph is taking place. I thought this would be fun to not only play but also learn and gain knowledge. I decided on this as I didnt find anything out there that was similar. I found one which uses google street view but does not use photographs taken from your friends social feed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;utitleu---photo-guesser&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Title&lt;/u&gt; - Photo Guesser&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;uconceptu&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Concept&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A game in which a user has to guess the place where the photo was taken based on photos from google images, flickr, Instagram etc and from photos take by his friends on social networks and also from top news stories of the last 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;uuseru&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;User&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A user would be someone who is interested in playing a game for fun or entertainment and also gain some knowledge from the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;ustoryu&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Story&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A user is interested in keeping up with news, his social feed or just wants to explore the world. Instead of showing them articles, the user sees the world through photos. If they get the right answers they are given a short summary of the event and can explore more from inside the app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;uwireframesu&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Wireframes&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adarshk.com/itp/images/work/AOAC-first2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adarshk.com/itp/images/work/AOAC-last2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adarshk.com/itp/images/work/allWireframes.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--
&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;images/work/AOAC-first2.png&quot; alt=&quot;StartScreen&quot;&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;images/work/AOAC-last2.png&quot; alt=&quot;GameScreen&quot;&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;images/work/allWireframes.png&quot; alt=&quot;GameScreen&quot;&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
--&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;part-2---response-to-the-fable-of-the-user-centered-designer&quot;&gt;Part 2 - Response to ‘The Fable of the User-Centered Designer’&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After reading the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.userfocus.co.uk/pdf/fable.pdf&quot;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt;, its amazing how the author uses examples and story to clearly drive the important points. A lot designers are drowned in decisions about what to use and forget completely about the actual users. The 3 key points that the author makes are I think pretty powerful. I also think it extends beyond design to everything from programming to writing reusable code that can be maintained to aesthetics and ergonomics in any product. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The philosophy somewhat reflects the current trend which is to move quickly, fail early and iterate. Also the fact that, this has to be done in every stage of the proces because its easy to lose focus if only done the first time. The early focus on how everyday users use it is much more important than how you as a designer may find it more pleasing. Approaching the task from the target audience perspective is will pay off in the end. s&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;h3 id=&quot;open-api&quot;&gt;Open API&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For open API this week, I initialy decided to use DuckDuckGo’s API but after coming across Giphy’s open &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/giphy/GiphyAPI&quot;&gt;API&lt;/a&gt; I couldnt resist.The API is well documented and JSON can be retrived with a url similar to this format. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;http://api.giphy.com/v1/gifs/search?q=funny+cat&amp;amp;api_key=dc6zaTOxFJmzC 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example a search for the terms ‘are+you+serious’ returns json with a bunch of gif urls with different formats such as fixed height, fixed width etc.  You can also retrieve gifs by id, tag and trending.By reading their license, it looks like, the number of requests are determined at their discretion but since its in beta they are allowing unrestricted access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also find the html/css source &lt;a href=&quot;mashups/wk1/index.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;h3 id=&quot;relationship-with-my-phone&quot;&gt;Relationship with my phone&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The relationship with my phone is somewhat a strange one. I have been using one for many years now. Over the years, the amount of time I spend with it has only increased. And the amount of time I am &lt;em&gt;expected&lt;/em&gt; to spend with it has also increased. By that I mean, I am expected to respond to emails, calls, texts etc faster. The people on the other side sending me stuff assume that I have already seen the content as soon as they sent it. While the number of ways to communicate has taken on different forms such as social networking sites, photo sharing, the phone is still the primary enabler of this complex connected world. Ten years ago this was not the case. I did not own a cellphone that time let alone a featurephone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowadays almost everything is done through my phone. Bus, Plane, Train, Movie tickets, receipts, exchanging text, photos, having video calls, playing games, connecting with friends on social networks, consuming news and a lot of times buying things. In fact there are very few things that I dont do with my phone. With my phone carrying such a huge importance, it is not over the top to say the phone is merely an extension of me. It has become such an important part of my life that I couldnt imagine a life without it. My smartphone has become the de facto way of living life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the value of the phone is less about the monetary price of the object and more about incredible human value and life memories that I derive from it. But it can also be an easy distraction. Just like any other medium its not without its problems. Because communication has become so cheap I value it less everyday. It’s easy to forsake human relationships by substituting your phone. But it’s also true vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I said in the beginning the relationship with my phone is somewhat a strange one. Whenever I want to get some work done I usually put it aside and not let it distract me. However looking forward I only see this getting reversed. As more of the functionality moves into the phone, it will only make it harder to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;
