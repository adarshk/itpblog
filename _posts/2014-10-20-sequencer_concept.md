#### Sequencer Concept

I am really interested in exploring making a sequencer using animations. Screen based online sequencers sometimes feel clunky and unintuitive to use. However this I feel is due to people trying to map actual components directly onto the screen. For example dials and drag bars are meant to be more physical. One way to experience sound is through visualizations. However they have little in terms of actual interaction. 

I want to explore the intersection of these two. By using animation, I want to create a sequencer that is somewhat experimental. It can be driven by emotions or shapes that have character. 

Here are some inspirations:

Patterns:
	I want to use color as a medium to explore patterns. Pitch and velocity along with loops will be used. These will be mapped to the animations directly so a particular pattern will generate particular patterns. Different instruments can be selected as well.

Tone:
	The duration and volume will be adjusted to for example using an interaction for example a pull or push action. The timbre will be mapped to the roughness or smoothness of the material.
	
Scale:
	The usual layout with keys will be present maybe not in a linear grid system but in a more dynamic form. 
	

So in essence something like creating generative visualizations using generative music. I am also thinking of the ability to record whatever the user creates to be able to play it back. This will made using Cinder or Javascript.
