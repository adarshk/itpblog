I decide to make a concept for a fun game in which photos are pulled from your social feed or from the current trending news and you have to fill in a place where the event in the photograph is taking place. I thought this would be fun to not only play but also learn and gain knowledge. I decided on this as I didnt find anything out there that was similar. I found one which uses google street view but does not use photographs taken from your friends social feed.

##### <u>Title</u> - Photo Guesser

##### <u>Concept</u> 
A game in which a user has to guess the place where the photo was taken based on photos from google images, flickr, Instagram etc and from photos take by his friends on social networks and also from top news stories of the last 24 hours.

##### <u>User</u> 
A user would be someone who is interested in playing a game for fun or entertainment and also gain some knowledge from the process.

##### <u>Story</u>
A user is interested in keeping up with news, his social feed or just wants to explore the world. Instead of showing them articles, the user sees the world through photos. If they get the right answers they are given a short summary of the event and can explore more from inside the app.

##### <u>Wireframes</u>

#### Part 2 - Response to 'The Fable of the User-Centered Designer'

After reading the [book](http://www.userfocus.co.uk/pdf/fable.pdf), its amazing how the author uses examples and story to clearly drive the important points. A lot designers are drowned in decisions about what to use and forget completely about the actual users. The 3 key points that the author makes are I think pretty powerful. I also think it extends beyond design to everything from programming to writing reusable code that can be maintained to aesthetics and ergonomics in any product. 

The philosophy somewhat reflects the current trend which is to move quickly, fail early and iterate. Also the fact that, this has to be done in every stage of the proces because its easy to lose focus if only done the first time. The early focus on how everyday users use it is much more important than how you as a designer may find it more pleasing. Approaching the task from the target audience perspective is will pay off in the end. s
