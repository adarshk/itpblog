#### Week 1

During the class, we were assigned to design an interface for a sequencer using only the words that we got from the oblique strategies [website](http://www.joshharrison.net/oblique-strategies/). I and [Jeff](http://www.jffng.com/) got 

#### 1. Listen to the quiet voice and 2.Which parts can be grouped

We chose [this](http://proto.blandhand.net/patr/) sequencer that we found online to do our drawings. 

We ended up with a dial layout that can be changed easily. We grouped the buttons together - play & shuffle, clear and reset and  pace & length. And finally we grouped the tones and made these as buttons instead of a drop down on the website.
