I used last fm api to retrieve the top tracks from a list of countries.
For each track, I am getting the number of listeners along with the name of the track and artist.
I then use google maps to get the coordinates for each country. I am displaying these as markers on the map.

I also used two.js to put dots on the map. However I want to continue working on this next week to animate the dots according to the track.

Find the code [here](mashups/wk4/withMarkers/project.html) with markers.
