### 'Mobile Payments Presentation'

The task this week was to choose any topic related to how connected devices affect our lives, particularly mobile phones. I and Yu Ji decided to present on mobile payments.

The problem is that a lot of tech companies have been trying to solve the problem of mobile payments. It particularly took off when square reader was introduced a few years back. And then a lot services started using NFC especially google wallet. With the recent talks that Apple maybe introducing its own service, this is definitely going to be a huge market in itself. But until now, it has not been as successful as the industry had hoped initially. This has seen Google going back to introducing a debit card based service along with Mastercard. In the presentation below, we also talk about the future implications mobile payments may have. Please take a look at it below.
