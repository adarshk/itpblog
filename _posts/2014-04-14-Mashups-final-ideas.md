### Story Telling app


####Idea 1:  

I want to continue working on my previous idea which is creating a storytelling app that offers the ability to use APIs directly in a drag and drop style.
I am also working on having a user log in and signup pages so that whatever API the user decides to use, it is associated with the user when they log in the next time.

You can see a prototype [here](http://evening-wave-1710.herokuapp.com/)


####Idea 2:

Creating animation style web based story that automatically starts playing when a user loads the page. Telling the story using the web as a medium.
